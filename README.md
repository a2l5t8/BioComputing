## Introduction

Bio-inspired computing algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by natural processes. They are particularly useful for solving complex optimization problems that are difficult to tackle with traditional methods. This repository provides Python implementations of several popular bio-inspired algorithms, along with examples and documentation to help you get started.

## Algorithms

### Genetic Algorithms (GA)
Genetic Algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection. They work by evolving a population of candidate solutions over several generations to find the optimal solution.

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
Ant Colony Optimization is inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. It is used to solve combinatorial optimization problems by simulating the pheromone trail-laying and following behavior of ants.

### Simulated Annealing (SA)
Simulated Annealing is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. It is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function.

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
Particle Swarm Optimization is inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish. It optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality.

## Installation

To use the algorithms in this repository, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate jupyter notebook. You can import and use them in your own Python scripts. All you need to do is to copy the class code of each algorithm and rewrite the `fitness_function` and if you want to specify anything else feel free to change the implementation.

```python

# Define your objective function
def fitness_function(x):
    return -x**2 + 5*x - 6

# Initialize and run the Genetic Algorithm
ga = GA(fitness_function, population_size=100, generations=50)
best_solution = ga.run()
print(f"Best solution: {best_solution}")
```

## Examples

This repository includes example scripts demonstrating how to use each algorithm. Check the `notebook.ipynb` for detailed examples and usage instructions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements or new algorithms to add, please fork the repository and submit a pull request. Make sure to include tests and documentation for your changes.
